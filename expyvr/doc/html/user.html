        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p><i>ExpyVR Exerpiment Designer</i> is part of the <i>ExpyVR</i>
          framework developed by the Laboratory of Cognitive
          Neuroscience at EPFL. ExpyVR is made for designing and running
          computerised experiments, most notably experiments in
          virtual-reality. It is based on the open-source project <a
            href="http://www.psychopy.org/">PsychoPy</a>.</p>
        <p>The <i>Experiment Designer</i> is the core user interface of
          the framework. It allows to define the general flow of the
          experiment and the detailed timing of all its components.
          Randomised experimental conditions can be set and the
          components can be configured to behave differently depending
          on the condition. Once an experiment is created, it can
          directly be started from the designer, or executed
          independently (e.g. using <i>runexperiment.bat</i>)</p>
        <p>The ExpyVR framework is still in development. This guide
          might therefore not always be up-to-date.</p>
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h3 id="units">Units and Precision</h3>
        Units used are always SI units. All times are therefore in
        seconds but the precision is in milliseconds.
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h3 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Component:</b> A component encapsulates the code for
            displaying something (e.g. a picture) and/or performing some
            operations (e.g. reading a sensor). </li>
          <li><b>Routine:</b> A routine defines the precise execution
            timelines of multiple components for one or more
            experimental conditions.</li>
          <li><b>ISI:</b> An Inter-Stimulus-Interval represents a pause
            in between routines. It can have a variable duration.</li>
          <li><b>Flow:</b> The flow of an experiment defines the
            sequence and loops of routines and ISI (not their timing).</li>
          <li><b>Experiment</b>: An experiment is made of a flow
            (populated with routines and ISI) and of various components.
            It is stored in an experiment file with the suffix
            *.exp.xml.</li>
          <li><b>Experiment instance:</b> An experiment instance is
            needed for executing an experiment. It defines the exact
            sequence of routines and ISIs, with all the randomisation
            from the loops decided. Eventually, running an experiment
            with multiple subjects will require several instances, one
            for each combination of conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h2 id="designing">Designing</h2>
        The Experiment Designer is divided into two main areas: the
        smaller flow area on top and the routine area that fills up most
        of the screen.The latter is itself divided into three areas; the
        routine timeline in the center and the components creation and
        selection on the sides<br>
        <img style=" width: 800px; height: 600px;" alt="window of
          ExpyVR" src="images/window.png"><br>
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h3 id="flow">Flow</h3>
        The flow area shows the big picture of the experiment; the
        different parts (routines, ISIs, loops), their order and
        possibly loops in the flow. On the left side there are three
        buttons to add the different elements to the flow:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Add Routine:</b> Enter the name of the new routine and
            set its position in the flow.</li>
          <li><b>Add Loop:</b> Enter the name of the new loop, the start
            and the end position in the flow and the number of times
            this loop should be followed. Loops can have a random
            variable associated. Each time the loop is followed a value
            is associated to the variable. Based on these values, the
            experimental conditions of the routines inside that loop are
            generated. The value of the variable is selected from a set
            that can be specified as comma-separated values. It depends
            on the type of loop how exactly the available values are
            specified and later selected. The four types of loops are:
            <ul>
              <li><i>Fix:</i> There is no loop variable. Simply repeat
                the elements inside this loop for a certain number of
                times.</li>
              <li><i>Random:</i> Randomly select an element from the
                set. This is selection with replacement and will create
                unbalanced selections.</li>
              <li><i>Shuffle:</i> Create a random permutation of the
                set. This is selection without replacement and will
                create balanced selections. If the number of values
                given is smaller than the number of repetitions, the set
                is repeated until it has enough elements and then only
                shuffled. If the number of repetitions is not divisible
                by the number of elements in the set, the selection will
                not be balanced.</li>
              <li><i>Factorial:</i> Has two sets. All possible
                combinations of the sets are automatically generated.
                The resulting set of values is then randomly permuted.
                The loop is repeated exactly once for every possible
                value. The same thing can be achieved with a shuffle
                loop, but the factorial loop makes it easier to create
                experiments with a factorial design.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Add ISI:</b> Enter the name of the new ISI, its
            position in the flow and the minimum and maximum duration in
            between which the actual duration will be selected uniform
            randomly from.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each routine created can contain several <b>experimental
            conditions</b>. Every routine automatically generates all
          the conditions that are possible given the loop variables from
          the surrounding loops. As an example, we take a routine that
          inside two random loops. One of the loops has the set <i>sync,

            async</i> and the other <i>left, middle, right</i>. Our
          routine will have a total of six conditions: <i>sync-left,
            sync-middle, sync-right, async-left, async-middle,
            async-right</i>. <b>Careful:</b> When you change the names
          or amount of loop variables or the position of a routine, the
          conditions change automatically. Make sure that your condition
          timelines still look OK if you make such a change.</p>
        <p>To change, move or remove an existing component in the flow
          simply left click (or right click, same effect) on it and
          select the appropriate action from the context menu. The
          context menu is placed in a way that you can double click on a
          component to select the first action in the list.</p>
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>Each component that can be created corresponds to a module in
          the ExpyVR framework. For more detailed information on components
          and their parameters, see the <a href="modules.html">Module Documentation</a>
          section. New modules can be easily added by programming in Python. More 
          details can be found in the <a href="programmer.html">Programmer's Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>Following is a quick description of the main components:</p>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>On the right of the window there is a panel for all the
          components that can be created. On the left there is a panel
          of the instances of components which have been created. Each
          component that you create has to be given a unique name. Some
          components have other parameters used for their initialization
          (e.g. the id of the camera for a webcam module).</p>
        <p>Different <b>configurations</b> can be created for a
          component, offering the possibility to change its behavior
          when inserted into a routine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is always a configuration entitled <i>standard</i>
            which defines the normal behaviour of this component.</li>
          <li>The other configurations are based on the standard
            configuration, except the parameters where the flag <i>'as
              in standard'</i> is unchecked and for which another
            user-defined value is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="toContents"><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
        <h3 id="routines">Routines</h3>
        <p>The routine area, in the center of the window, has a tab bar
          on top which allows to define what is executed for each
          experimental condition. A component is inserted to the current
          condition of a routine by selecting <i>add to condition</i>
          or <i>add to all conditions</i> from the context menu when
          clicking on the component (left panel).</p>
        <p>The parameters to define the timing of a component when
          inserted in the timeline of a routine are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Display times:</b> Every component that can be
            displayed in the virtual scene has a set of display times.
            For every time you want the this component to be shown
            during the experiment you have to specify the start time and
            the duration of the display. Display times are represented
            in red in the timeline.</li>
          <li><b>Activation times:</b> All components can be activated
            for certain time periods. What activation means exactly
            depends on the type of component and on the parameters you
            set. Activation times are represented in blue in the
            timeline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inside the main area you can see a timeline for each
          component of the condition of a routine: the red bar shows
          when a component is displayed and the blue bar when it is
          active. Timing properties of a component can be edited by
          clicking on the timeline and selcting <i>edit</i>. To remove
          an instance or move it up and down in the display order,
          select the appropriate action from the context menu.</p>
        <p>For instance, the fixation cross module is displayable (draws
          a cross), but its activation is pretty useless as nothing
          changes (it is safe to put a zero duration activation time).
          To the contrary, the Audio module is not displayable, but the
          activation times are important as they define when to play the
          sound. Many active components need both display and activation
          times; the movie module will play the file during the
          activation times, but show it only during the display times.</p>
        <p>A component inside a routine will be executed according to
          the <b>configuration</b> selected for this timeline in the
          combo-box under its name. Configurations can be created and
          edited in the component properties dialog. This dialog is
          opened at the creation time of the component, or by a clicking
          on its icon in the <i>Experiment Components</i> panel and
          selecting <i>edit</i>.</p>

        <h3 id="settings">General settings</h3>
        In the tool bar of <i>Experiment Designer </i>are two buttons
        for general settings. These settings are used for the whole
        experiment and are defining how to log the events during the
        execution and how to setup the display window.
        <h4><img style=" width: 32px; height: 32px;" class="inline"
            alt="Logger settings icon"
            src="../../src/expbuilder/app/resources/settingsExp32.png"
            align="middle"> Logger</h4>
        During the execution of an experiment all of the modules
        generate a lot of logging data to keep track of when they are
        turned on and off and what they are doing exactly. In the logger
        settings, you can set whether the logging should be done to
        standard output console and/or to a file.<br>
        It is also a good idea to configure where you want the logs to
        be saved by setting the 'savepath'.<br>
        <h4><img style=" width: 32px; height: 32px;" class="inline"
            alt="Logger settings icon"
            src="../../src/expbuilder/app/resources/monitors32.png"
            align="middle"> Display</h4>
        In the display settings you can define how and on which window
        the experiment should be displayed. You can add multiple windows
        that are rendered into different screens. The following
        parameters also set here:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">pos (X, Y, Z) </span>:
            position of the camera in 3D world<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">angle (X, Y, Z)</span> :
            rotation of the camera as Euler angles (zeros means looking
            forward in Z)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">mode </span>: rendering
            mode for monoscopic or stereoscopic screen (various stereo
            settings available)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">size </span>: dimensions
            of the window in pixels (when not fullscreen)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">fov </span>: horizontal
            field of view of the camera (in degrees)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">fullscreen </span>:
            display in fullscreen mode (window dimension becomes the
            size of the screen)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">screenid </span>:
            identifier of the screen where to show the fullscreen (from
            Windows display settings)<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flipscreen </span>: flip
            the display vertically<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">color </span>: color of
            the background (RGB values in [0.0, 1.0]<br>
          </li>

        <h2 id="running">Running</h2>
        During the development of the experiment you can easily test
        your experiment without generating an instance. The experiment
        always has to be saved though before running a test or
        generating an instance. After finishing the design of an
        experiment, you can create instances for your subjects.

          They can be saved and loaded in ExpyVR <i>Experiment Designer</i>
          program.</p>
        <p>You should save your experiment file every time you change
          something in the configuration of your experiment.</p>

        You can use the <i>Test Experiment</i> button or press
        [CTRL]+[T] to test the experiment. You have to save the
        exerpiment before doing so. The randomisation of the loop
        variables and ISI lengths is performed for every separate test
        run of the experiment.<br>
        <br>
        NB: When testing, the main window is frozen until you close the
        experiment window(s).<br>

            align="middle"> Instance files; *.inst.xml</h4>
        <p>Instance files contain the parameters selected by the
          computer according to the randomisations requested by the user
          in an experiment (e.g. randomization of loop conditions).</p>
        <p>Instances can be generated by selecting <i>Generate Instance</i>
          from the <i>Experiment</i> menu or pressing the orange button
          in the toolbar. When generating an instance file, <i>Experiment

            Designer</i> goes through all the loops and does the
          randomisation to find the sequence of experimental conditions.
          Also all the durations of all the ISIs are randomly selected
          within the given bounds. This is stored to a file that can be
          loaded later to start the experiment. All the information
          present in the instance file is the sequence of routines and
          ISIs, the experimental conditions of the routines and the
          duration of the ISIs.</p>
        <p>You should (re)generate an instance every time you change the
          flow. All the other parameters such as the timeline of the
          routines being stored in the experiment file, you do not have
          to regenerate the instances if you only change the settings of
          a component or its timing. In doubt, it is safe to re-generate
          and instance each time you save the experiment.</p>

            align="middle"> Starting</h4>
        <p>Instances can be executed by selecting<i> Execute Instance</i>
          from the <i>Experiment</i> menu or by pressing the green
          button in the toolbar. Once you selected an instance file, the
          experiment is immediately started. To quickly restart the last
          executed instance, select <i>'Re-execute last instance'</i>
          in the menu, or just press [CTRL]+[R].</p>
        <p>Instances can also be executed without ExpyVR Experiment
          Designer interface ; you can use the <i>'runexperiment.bat</i>'
          batch file instead.</p>
